            <h2>Branding</h2>
                <p>This is arguably the most important aspect of starting your business. It can also be the most fun. Your branding helps your audience to differentiate you from competitors and helps to build their trust in you. Branding is the first thing that customers come into contact with, so make a good first impression! Depending on your background, you can skip this step altogether and work with a graphic designer to build your brand or you can do the branding yourself.</p>
                <h3 id="audience">Identify your audience</h3>
                    <p>The audience of your product is those people you want to market to. These are the people you want to speak directly to and say “Hey, you should buy my stickers!” In other words, who do you think would be interested in your stickers? This is your target market. For this, you want to be specific. An example would be: “Women aged 22-45 who enjoy arts and crafts. Instead of buying generic stickers from big stores like Michaels, they are willing to pay more for handmade, quality stickers.”</p>
                    <p>Once you know who your audience is, you can start designing your branding around their expectations. The most important thing to remember is this: don’t design for yourself, design for your audience. </p>
                <h3 id="nameandtagline">Coming up with a name and tagline</h3>
                    <p>Your business name should be short and memorable. Something that will be meaningful but also catchy. Some questions you can ask yourself for this would be: </p>
                        <ul class="businessnamelist">
                            <li>What mood do you want your brand to have? 
                            </li>
                            <li>What emotions do you want your brand to evoke?
                            </li>
                            <li>What do you want people to think of when they hear your brand name?</li>
                            <li>What are the mission/values of your business? </li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>This criteria also applies when formulating your tagline. According to Steve Krug in his book Don’t Make Me Think, “Good taglines convey differentiation and a clear benefit.”  (insert page #) What is different about your business? What benefits will the customer receive if they purchase from your business? For example: Disneyland’s tagline is “The Happiest Place on Earth.” This shows how they are better than the competition and how the customer will benefit by being at Disneyland. </p>
                <h3 id="color">Deciding Your Brand Colors</h3>
                        <p>The colors of your brand should also communicate the mood of your brand, but in a more visual way than your business name and tagline. If you want your brand to seem fun and cheery, you may consider using colors like orange, yellow, and pink. If you want your brand to seem moody, you could use colors like black, gray, and purple. It is also worth looking into the meaning of colors. For example, red usually communicates excitement while light purple communicates calm. I would recommend utilizing the site Coolors, which generates color palettes for you. </p>
                    <h3 id="logo">Creating Your Logo</h3>
                        <p>This is the fun part. Combining everything that you have prepared: tagline, business name, and colors, you can now make your logo. Like the tagline and business name, you will want your logo to be simple yet memorable. Think of Nike and Apple. I bet you just envisioned the Apple icon and the Nike swoosh. These brands are so popular partly because they people know who they are. You also may want to add your logo to items like shirts and your social media profile pictures. For this purpose, ensure the logo can be scaled down to a smaller size and still be readable and legible.   
                        </p>
                    <h3 id="pattern">Brand pattern</h3>
                        <p>Your brand pattern can be used on anything from packaging, social media and even your business card. Consider using your logo repeated or something even more simple than your logo so it can be repeated without being too cluttered. </p>
